# Basic-antivirus-simulation-
The Basic Antivirus Simulation is a Python-based educational project that demonstrates how signature-based antivirus engines work. It scans files and folders, calculates cryptographic hashes (SHA-256), compares them with a known malware signature database, and flags or quarantines detected files.
Objectives

Understand how signature-based antivirus detection works

Learn hashing algorithms (SHA-256)

Implement file scanning and comparison logic

Understand quarantine mechanisms used in security software

Build a basic security automation tool using Python
